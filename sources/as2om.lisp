Converts partials-analysis data, obtained from AudioSculpt by the 'Export Partials' command,
in a suitable format for displaying and manipulating in OM

parameters : 

analyse : connect here the output of a text module containing the partial analysis.
vmin,vmax : integers, amplitudes will be scaled as Midi Velocities between  vmin and vmax
delta: integer, events whose onset-time fall within a window of <delta> 1/1000sec will be gathered into chords
mmin,mmax: midic values that define the allowed pitch range for the output.
approx: 1,2,4, or 8. Micro-tonal approximation.
npoly: tries and reduce the polyphony to <npoly> notes at the same time by taking the louder partials first.

output : 

a list of chords to be connected to a chordseq module.
